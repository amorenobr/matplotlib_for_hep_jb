## Higgs Production Mechanisms at Hadron Colliders

The four main Higgs production mechanisms at a hadron collider are

The Higgs boson can decay into fermions and bosons, the total decay width and the branching ratios in function of the Higgs mass are shown below

## Higgs boson decay into four leptons

We are going to focus on the data obtained at the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC for the Vector Boson Fusion production mechanism and its subsequent decay into four leptons in order to get this plot using Matplotlib
